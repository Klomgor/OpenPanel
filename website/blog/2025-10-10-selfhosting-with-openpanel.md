The cloud is everywhere. From file storage to website hosting, most of our digital lives are being managed by third-party providers. While these services are convenient, they often come with trade-offs: recurring costs, vendor lock-in, limited flexibility, and most importantly — loss of control over your own data.

That’s where [OpenPanel](/) steps in. As a freemium web hosting control panel, OpenPanel lets you take back ownership of your digital infrastructure without sacrificing usability or features.

## Why Not Just Stick With the Cloud (or Typical Panels)?

Sticking with third-party clouds or other panels seems like low friction, but costs and limitations stack up over time. Here are a few reasons people are reconsidering:

* **Recurring & unpredictable costs** – as you scale (more domains, more users, heavy traffic), fees creep up.
* **License cost inflation** – for example, **cPanel licenses have surged repeatedly** in recent years. [They’ve raised prices](https://web.archive.org/web/20200403001818/https://cpanel.net/pricing/) annually (≈ 10 % or more) for multiple tiers.
* **Limited flexibility** – many panels or clouds force particular stacks, can restrict what you run, or charge extra for features you want.
* **Dependency & migration pain** – moving away from a cloud provider or a closed panel later is a hassle. Backups, configuration differences, downtime — it all adds friction.

## What Can You Self-Host with OpenPanel

OpenPanel isn’t just for websites. If you self-host with it, you can centralize many services:

* **Websites & Web Apps** — static sites, WordPress, Laravel, Node.js, Django, etc.
* **Email** — your own mail server(s), custom addresses, control over spam, logs, retention.
* **DNS** — run your own nameservers; manage domains/zones yourself.
* **FTP / File Storage** — for backups, collaboration, transfers.
* **Docker images / Containers** — deploy virtually any app that runs in a container: analytics dashboards, chat servers, dev tools, game servers, custom services.
* **Additional services** — monitoring tools, private VPNs, version control (Git), even self-hosted video/media servers.

## Why OpenPanel Makes Self-Hosting Practical

OpenPanel solves some of the biggest headaches that usually keep people tied to third-party clouds or panels:

* **OS-Agnostic** — works on any major Linux distribution, so you’re not locked into a specific distro.
* **Server-Portability** — migrating from one server to another is straightforward, making upgrades or hardware changes simpler.
* **Full control over your data & infrastructure** — you decide what runs, where it runs, and how it’s secured.
* **Predictable & often lower costs** — especially compared to panels like cPanel, whose licenses have surged repeatedly.
* **Flexibility & experimentation** — run custom apps or obscure open-source tools via Docker.
* **Scalable path** — start small, grow as needed. Community and Enterprise editions let you expand without re-platforming.

## Getting Started (Rough Steps)

1. [Get a server](/hosting-providers) (VPS, dedicated, or cloud instance under your control).
2. Install OpenPanel following the [install script](/install) or docs.
3. Configure your services: websites, domains, email, Docker containers, backups.
4. Keep your infrastructure updated and [secure](/docs/articles/security/securing-openpanel/) — self-hosting requires responsibility.

## Bottom Line

Self-hosting with OpenPanel gives you control, flexibility, and cost predictability — while supporting websites, email, DNS, Dockerized apps, file storage, and more. Its OS-agnostic design and server portability make it a practical alternative to expensive, restrictive panels or third-party clouds.

If rising license fees or cloud lock-in have frustrated you, OpenPanel offers a modern, flexible way to take your digital infrastructure into your own hands.
