# Services

The Services page allows you to view current real-time resource usage for your services and manage them.

:::info
The Services page appears only if the 'services' module is enabled on the server and included as a feature in your hosting plan.
To start or stop services, use the Docker feature (if available) or contact your hosting provider.

To manage a service, select it's name from the select options.

On the single service page you can view:

- current service status
- resource usage (CPU%, Memory%, Disk I/O, PIDs..)
- container name (to be used to connect to service from other containers)
- manage options: enable/disable
- container logs
